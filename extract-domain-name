# Write a function that when given a URL as a string, parses out just the domain name and returns it as a string.
# For example, if given "https://github.com/AaronSedai" the function will return "github" as the domain name.

def domain_name(url):
    # create a variable and replace all http://, https://, and www. with nothing
    domain = url.replace('http://', "").replace('https://', "").replace('www.', "")
    
    # split the created variable at the dot with a new variable
    domain2 = domain.split(".")
    
    # return the zero index of the new variable
    return domain2[0]
