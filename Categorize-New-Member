# In this problem we need to categorize a new member of the Croquet Club as either 'Senior' or 'Open' with the following descriptions defining the categories
# Senior = at least 55 years old and has a handicap of greater than 7
# Handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap

def open_or_senior(data):
   category = []
    
   for x in data:
       if x[0] >= 55 and x[1] > 7:
           category.append("Senior")
       else:
           category.append("Open")
    
   return category

# create an empty list
# for loop through 'data' in def open_or_senior
    # if age is 55+ and handicap is over 7, category is...Senior!
    # if anything besides that, category is...Open
    # (the information about handicaps being -2 to +26 is unnecessary. don't overthink it!)
    # append x to the appropriate category
 # return the new list called 'category'
