# For this problem, we will take a list of positive integers and strings and filter out the strings. The new list should only include the integers from the first list.

def filter_list(l):
    return [x for x in l if isinstance(x, int) and x >= 0]

# use a for loop to go through the list
# use the 'isinstance' to find the int types in 'l'
# eliminate negative options with x >= 0
