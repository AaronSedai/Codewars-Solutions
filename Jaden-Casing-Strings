# Jaden Smith is known for capitalizing every word he writes on social media. In this problem, we are taking a string and returning it with every word capitalized as Jaden Smith does

def to_jaden_case(string):
    output = ' '.join(a.capitalize() for a in string.split())
    return output

# create a string variable called 'output' (or whatever you want to call it)
# use a for loop to split the string using .split()
# join it back with a capitalized first letter
  # using .capitalize()
# return the string variable
